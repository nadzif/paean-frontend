    "title": "Why Mitochondria-based Therapy?",
    "desc": "<p>Mitochondria are present in every human cell. They not only generate energy but also play an important role in cell proliferation, signaling, etc. Mitochondria have unique characteristics that can be delivered into cells through endocytosis.</p><p> Mitochondria are susceptible to damage by both internal (aging) and external factors (pollutants). Once they are damaged, cell function will deteriorate, and diseases may occur. With PAEAN's mitochondria-based therapeutics, we transform mitochondria into powerful biopharmaceutical agents to address critical medical needs.</p>",
    "approach": "Applying the unique characteristics of mitochondria and proprietary technology platform, PAEAN is developing a first-in-class mitochondria-based pharmaceutical product that has a large potential to treat various rare diseases and cancer."
